## 3. About me :

Hi, my name is Kirill, I'm 25 years old. At the age of 22, I graduated from IMSIT Krasnodar College with a degree in Computer Networks. For a long time I couldn't figure out what I needed, and then it dawned on me. I realized that I wanted to do programming. I have already received the basic skills. Diligent, I am good at searching for information. I am sure that this course will help me gain certain skills for future employment.
